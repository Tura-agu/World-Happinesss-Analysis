The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. Ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels; released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition and is used to describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations.  
The happiness score and ranking use data from Gallup World Poll. The scores are based off of The Cantril Self-Anchoring scale,  that consists of :

Respondents imagining a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top.
The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.
On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?
